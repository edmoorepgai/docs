At PG:AI, security is fundamental to how we build and operate our platform. We implement comprehensive security measures to protect your data and ensure the reliability of our services.

## Our Security Commitment

PG:AI was founded in 2024 with security as a core principle. We believe that trust is earned through transparency and consistent security practices, not just compliance checkboxes.

<Info>
  We are actively working with Drata to achieve SOC 2 certification, which we expect to complete within the next 6 months.
