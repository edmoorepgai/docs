## What are Custom Insights?

Custom Insights allow you to generate specific, targeted information about companies based on your defined queries and parameters. These insights appear on the Custom Insights page within any company profile.

Custom Insights are specific pieces of information that PG:AI generates about companies based on your defined queries and parameters. They provide structured, consistent information across all your accounts.

## What are Custom Insights used for?

- **Generating targeted insights** about companies based on your specific needs
- **Answering specific questions** about accounts consistently
- **Providing structured information** that appears on the Custom Insights page
- **Automating research** that would otherwise require manual investigation

## How Custom Insights Settings Work

The Custom Insights feature consists of two main components:

### 1. Custom Insights Tab

This is where you define individual insights:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Name Your Insight">
    Give your custom insight a clear, descriptive name that indicates what information it provides
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define the Query">
    Write the specific question or instruction that PG:AI follows to generate the insight. Be clear and specific about what you want to know.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Word Count">
    Define how detailed you want the insight to be:

    - Short (50-100 words): Quick summaries
    - Medium (100-200 words): Standard insights
    - Long (200\+ words): Detailed analysis
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  PG:AI provides three default insights that you can edit or use as templates for creating your own.
</Note>

### 2. Insights Groups Tab

Insights Groups organize and configure how insights are generated:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Title">
    Name for your group of insights - helps organize related insights together
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Sources">
    Select from:

    - **Public documents**: Annual reports, earnings calls, investor presentations
    - **Web information**: News articles, press releases, company websites
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Time Spans">
    Choose relevancy periods:

    - Last week
    - Last month
    - Last quarter
    - Last year
    - All time
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Keywords">
    Define terms that will be used alongside company names when searching for information
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Insight Selection">
    Choose which custom insights to include in this group
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 3. Automation

<Info>
  Custom Insights can be included in workflows to automatically generate when adding new accounts. This ensures consistency and saves time during account onboarding.

## Best Practices

### Creating Effective Queries

1. **Be Specific**: "What are this company's top 3 digital transformation initiatives?" rather than "Tell me about their strategy"
2. **Use Clear Language**: Avoid ambiguous terms or industry jargon that might be interpreted differently
3. **Focus on Actionable Information**: Design queries that provide insights you can act on
4. **Test and Refine**: Start with a few accounts to test your insights before applying them broadly

### Example Custom Insights

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Strategic Priorities">
    **Name**: Strategic Business Priorities

    **Query**: "What are the top 3-5 strategic business priorities for this company based on their most recent public statements and reports?"

    **Word Count**: 150
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Technology Initiatives">
    **Name**: Digital Transformation Projects

    **Query**: "Identify current digital transformation or technology modernization initiatives this company is undertaking, including timeline and scope if available"

    **Word Count**: 200
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Challenges">
    **Name**: Key Business Challenges

    **Query**: "What are the main challenges or pain points this company has publicly acknowledged they are trying to solve?"

    **Word Count**: 150
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
