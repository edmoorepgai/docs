## What are Engage Settings?

Engage Settings control how PG:AI builds the data on the Engage page, including value pyramids and "three whys" insights. These settings ensure your value proposition is consistently mapped to each account's specific needs.

Engage Settings dictate how PG:AI builds the data on the Engage page, such as value pyramids or "three whys" insights. These settings guide how the system finds and presents relevant information about account fit and value proposition.

## What are Engage Settings used for?

- **Configuring insights generation** on the Engage page
- **Defining parameters** for finding relevant information in accounts
- **Creating targeted approaches** for different industries or customer types
- **Ensuring consistency** in how value is communicated across your team

## How Engage Settings Work

### 1. Multiple Groups

You can create multiple Engage setting groups for different scenarios:

- Different industries (retail vs. financial services)
- Different company sizes (enterprise vs. mid-market)
- Different use cases (new logo vs. expansion)

### 2. Configuration Components

<Steps>
  <Step title="Name Your Settings">
    Provide a descriptive identifier for the settings group (e.g., "Enterprise Financial Services" or "Mid-Market Retail")
  </Step>
  <Step title="Solution Description">
    Write a detailed explanation of what your company does. This should include:

    - Core capabilities
    - Key differentiators
    - Primary value drivers
    - Target outcomes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Signals">
    Add terms that PG:AI will use to search for relevant information:

    - Industry-specific challenges
    - Technology keywords
    - Business initiatives
    - Pain point indicators
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Datasets">
    Choose which datasets to use as context data for generating insights
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 3. Best Practices

<Warning>
  **Important**: Do NOT mention your company name in the solution description. This ensures the content focuses on value and fit rather than being overly promotional.
</Warning>

#### Solution Description Guidelines

Your solution description should include:

- **What your company does** - Core functionality and capabilities
- **Strategies that make it a good fit** - Alignment with customer needs
- **Challenges you address** - Specific problems you solve

#### Creating Different Settings

Consider creating different Engage settings for:

- **Industry Verticals**: Retailers vs. banks vs. healthcare
- **Company Maturity**: Startups vs. established enterprises
- **Use Cases**: Digital transformation vs. cost optimization

### 4. Default Settings

<Note>
  PG:AI builds a default Engage setting automatically based on your initial configuration. You can modify this or create additional settings as needed.
