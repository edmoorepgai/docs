Personas help you identify and engage with the right people at your target accounts by defining groups of contacts who share common job functions, responsibilities, or characteristics. Configure personas to automatically find relevant contacts and generate role-specific content.

## What are Personas?

Personas are defined groups of people within organizations that share common characteristics:

- Job functions and responsibilities (DevOps teams, sales leaders, security professionals)
- Organizational levels (executives, directors, managers, individual contributors)
- Decision-making authority (budget holders, technical influencers, end users)
- Department affiliations (engineering, operations, finance, marketing)

<Info>
  Personas must be configured in Settings â†’ Personas to appear in the Contacts tab. The system identifies individuals whose job titles and roles match your defined persona criteria.

- Develop relationships across multiple organizational levels and departments

### **Personalized Engagement**

Well-defined personas help you:

- Create role-specific messaging that resonates with each stakeholder's priorities
- Generate appropriate discovery questions for different types of contacts
- Tailor value propositions to what matters most to each persona
- Adapt communication style and content depth to audience preferences

2. **Map the Buying Committee**: Include technical influencers, business decision-makers, and end users
3. **Consider Company Size**: Adjust persona definitions for enterprise vs. mid-market accounts
4. **Regular Refinement**: Update personas based on successful sales patterns

### **Contact Limit Strategy**
