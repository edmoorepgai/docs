Personas help you identify the right contacts at target accounts and generate content tailored to their specific roles and responsibilities.

<Info>
Personas must be configured in Settings â†’ Personas before they appear in the Contacts tab. The system finds contacts whose job titles match your persona criteria.
</Info>

## How It Works

1. **Define persona groups** - Create categories like "Technical Decision Makers" or "Security Leadership"
2. **Set search criteria** - Add job titles, departments, and organizational levels
3. **Find contacts** - System identifies matching people at your target accounts
4. **Generate content** - Create role-specific messaging for each persona
