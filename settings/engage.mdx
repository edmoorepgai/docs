Engage Settings control how PG:AI generates Value Pyramids, Three Whys frameworks, and Discovery Questions. These settings train the system to understand your solution and map it to account priorities.

<Info>
Engage Settings directly determine the quality and relevance of your generated sales content. Well-configured settings produce more compelling and accurate Value Pyramids and Discovery Questions.

## How It Works

Engage Settings consist of three components:

- **Solution Description** - What your solution does and the value it delivers
- **Search Signals** - Keywords that identify relevant account initiatives
- **Dataset Selection** - Which sales collateral to use for content generation

## Solution Description Structure

Organize your solution description with clear sections:

**Challenges:**
- Specific business problems you solve
- Pain points your solution addresses
- Operational inefficiencies you eliminate

**Strategies and Initiatives:**
- Transformation goals you enable
- Strategic outcomes you deliver
- Implementation benefits you provide

<Warning>
Avoid mentioning your company name in the solution description. Focus on solution value, not company branding.
</Warning>

## Search Signals

Add keywords that help identify relevant accounts:

- **Business initiatives** - Digital transformation, operational efficiency, cost optimization
- **Technology areas** - Cloud migration, AI implementation, data modernization  
- **Pain points** - Manual processes, security vulnerabilities, compliance gaps
- **Industry terms** - Regulatory compliance, sector-specific challenges

## Multiple Configurations

Create different Engage Settings for:

- **Different industries** - Financial Services vs Healthcare vs Manufacturing
- **Company segments** - Enterprise vs Mid-Market vs SMB approaches
- **Use cases** - New Logo vs Expansion vs Competitive Replacement

Most companies start with 2-3 configurations and add more as needed.

<Warning>
Regularly update your Engage Settings based on successful sales conversations. Outdated configurations generate less relevant content.
