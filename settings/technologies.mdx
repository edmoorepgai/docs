Favourite Technologies allows you to select from PG:AI's 12,000+ tracked technologies to create a personalized view focused on what matters most to your sales success.

## How It Works

1. Go to **Settings > Technologies**
2. Use the search bar or filters to find relevant technologies
3. Click the **heart icon** to add technologies to your favourites
4. Remove technologies by clicking the **X** on any favourite

Once configured, your Favourite Technologies appear as a dedicated "Favourites" category in the Tech Stack tab of company profiles.

## What to Include

Select technologies that are:

- **Competitors** you need to monitor or replace
- **Integration partners** that create opportunities
- **Buying signals** that indicate good fit for your solution
- **Complementary technologies** that enhance your value proposition

<Warning>
Keep your list focused - choose 15-25 technologies rather than 100+ to maintain filtering effectiveness.
</Warning>
