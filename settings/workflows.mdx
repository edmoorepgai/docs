## What are Workflows?

Workflows automate the process of generating custom insights and content for companies when you add new accounts to PG:AI. This ensures consistency and saves significant time during account onboarding.

Workflows are automated processes that generate custom insights and content for companies when you add a new account to the system. They act as templates that define what information should be automatically gathered and generated for each new account.

## How Workflow Settings Work

### 1. Creating a Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Workflows">
    Go to the Workflows tab in your settings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name Your Workflow">
    Provide a descriptive name that indicates the workflow's purpose (e.g., "Enterprise Account Onboarding" or "SMB Quick Start")
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Components">
    Select which elements to include in your automated process
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 2. Engage Settings

Select which Engage setting you want to use for this workflow. This determines how value propositions and engagement insights will be generated for new accounts.

### 3. Custom Insights

Choose which Custom Insights or content groups you want the workflow to generate:

- Strategic priorities analysis
- Technology landscape assessment
- Competitive positioning
- Business challenges identification
- Any custom insights you've created

### 4. Automation Process

When you add a new account:

1. The workflow triggers automatically
2. Selected Engage settings are applied
3. All chosen custom insights are generated
4. Content is populated in the account profile
5. The account is ready for your team to use

### 5. Default Options

<Note>
  The platform comes with a default workflow called "Platform Generator," which you can modify or supplement with your own workflows. This provides a good starting point for understanding workflow capabilities.
