Workflows automate the process of generating custom insights and engagement content when you add new accounts to PG:AI. Configure workflows to ensure consistent, comprehensive account intelligence is generated automatically, saving time and ensuring no critical research steps are missed.

## What are Workflows?

Workflows are automated processes that orchestrate the generation of account intelligence when new companies are added to your system:

- **Content Generation**: Automatically create Value Pyramids, Three Whys, and Discovery Questions
- **Intelligence Research**: Generate Custom Insights based on your defined research queries
- **Persona Analysis**: Identify relevant contacts and stakeholders across target personas
- **Consistent Onboarding**: Ensure uniform account preparation regardless of who adds the account

<Info>
  Workflows act as templates that define what information should be automatically gathered and generated for each new account, ensuring consistency and comprehensive coverage across your account base.

## Workflow Management Best Practices

### **Strategic Workflow Design**

<Warning>
  Start with 2-3 focused workflows rather than trying to create comprehensive workflows for every possible scenario. You can always add more specialized workflows as you identify patterns in your account types.
</Warning>

**Recommended Approach:**

1. **Primary Workflow**: Covers 70-80% of your target accounts with comprehensive intelligence
2. **Specialized Workflows**: Address specific industries, company sizes, or use cases
3. **Quick Qualification**: Streamlined version for high-volume account screening

### **Performance Optimization**

## Default Workflow and Customization
