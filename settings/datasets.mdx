Datasets are collections of your internal sales, marketing and product documents that train PG:AI to understand your value proposition, product capabilities, and sales messaging. Upload your existing sales collateral as PDFs, and PG:AI will ingest the content to generate personalized, on-brand materials for your team.

## What are Datasets?

Datasets are labeled collections of your sales documents that PG:AI uses to learn about your business:

- Upload any PDF documents containing your sales collateral
- Organize documents into clearly labeled datasets by topic or purpose
- PG:AI ingests the text content to understand your value propositions and messaging
- Use these trained datasets to power personalized content generation and account insights

<Info>
  Your first dataset is automatically created by ingesting your company website to train PG:AI on your basic value proposition and offerings. You can then add additional datasets with your internal sales materials.
