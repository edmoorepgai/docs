Datasets are collections of your internal sales, marketing and product documents that train PG:AI to understand your value proposition, product capabilities, and sales messaging. Upload your existing sales collateral as PDFs, and PG:AI will ingest the content to generate personalized, on-brand materials for your team.

## What are Datasets?

Datasets are labeled collections of your sales documents that PG:AI uses to learn about your business:

- Upload any PDF documents containing your sales collateral
- Organize documents into clearly labeled datasets by topic or purpose
- PG:AI ingests the text content to understand your value propositions and messaging
- Use these trained datasets to power personalized content generation and account insights

<Info>
  Your first dataset is automatically created by ingesting your company website to train PG:AI on your basic value proposition and offerings. You can then add additional datasets with your internal sales materials.

</Warning>

**Best Practices for Dataset Organization:**

1. **Clear Labels**: Use descriptive names that indicate the content type and purpose
2. **Logical Grouping**: Group related documents together by theme, audience, or solution area
3. **Regular Updates**: Add new case studies, battle cards, and product information as they're created
4. **Quality Control**: Ensure uploaded documents contain your current, approved messaging

    - Ensure competitive information is accurate and up-to-date
    - Remove any confidential or sensitive information before uploading
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Format Considerations">
    - PDFs with clear, readable text work best for content extraction
    - Avoid image-heavy documents with minimal text content
    - Ensure scanned documents have good OCR text recognition
    - Break up very long documents into focused, topic-specific files
