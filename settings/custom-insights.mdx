Custom Insights let you create specific research questions that PG:AI answers for every account. Define queries that align with your sales process to generate consistent, targeted intelligence across all accounts.

<Info>
Custom Insights determine what targeted intelligence appears on the Custom Insights tab for each account. Well-configured insights provide sales-relevant research that would otherwise require manual investigation.
</Info>

## How It Works

Custom Insights consist of two components:

- **Individual Insights** - Specific research questions answered for each account
- **Insights Groups** - Collections of insights with shared sources and timeframes

## Creating Individual Insights

<Steps>
  <Step title="Name your insight">
    Use clear names like "Cloud Security Challenges" or "AI Implementation Status"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write your research query">
    Create specific questions that PG:AI will answer about each account
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set response length">
    Choose Short (50-100 words), Medium (100-200 words), or Long (200+ words)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test and refine">
    Generate sample insights on known accounts to validate effectiveness
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Writing Effective Queries

**Good Examples:**
- "What are the recent cloud security challenges faced by this company?"
- "How is this company leveraging AI in their operations?"
- "What data infrastructure challenges are mentioned about this company?"

**Avoid Generic Queries:**
- "Tell me about their strategy" (too broad)
- "What do they do?" (basic information)
- "Are they a good fit?" (requires solution context)

<Warning>
Make queries specific to your solution area. Generic questions produce generic insights that don't help with sales conversations.
</Warning>

## Creating Insights Groups

Groups let you organize related insights with shared parameters:

- **Sources** - Public documents (annual reports, SEC filings) vs web information (news, press releases)
- **Time span** - Last week, month, quarter, year, or all time
- **Keywords** - Terms that help focus research on relevant topics

Most companies create 2-4 insights groups covering their key sales focus areas.
