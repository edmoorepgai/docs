Custom Insights Settings allow you to create targeted, consistent intelligence about your accounts by defining specific queries that PG:AI will answer for every company. Configure custom research questions that align with your sales process and generate standardized insights across all accounts.

## What are Custom Insights Settings?

Custom Insights Settings consist of two main components that work together to generate targeted account intelligence:

- **Individual Custom Insights**: Specific questions or research queries you want answered about each account
- **Insights Groups**: Collections of insights with defined sources, timeframes, and targeting parameters
- **Automated Generation**: Consistent intelligence production across all accounts based on your defined criteria

<Info>
  Custom Insights Settings determine what targeted intelligence appears on the Custom Insights tab for each account. Well-configured settings provide consistent, sales-relevant research that would otherwise require manual investigation.
