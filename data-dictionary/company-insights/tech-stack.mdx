description: "Understand your accounts' technology landscape and infrastructure"
---

The Tech Stack feature provides comprehensive insights into your target accounts' technology infrastructure by analyzing job postings, online data, and other digital footprints to reveal what technologies they actively use and invest in.

## How Tech Stack Intelligence Works

PG:AI analyzes multiple data sources to build a complete picture of each account's technology environment:

- **Job Postings**: Requirements and skills mentioned in recent job listings
- **Online Presence**: Technology mentions in company content and documentation
- **Digital Footprint**: Technical indicators from web presence and applications
- **Investment Signals**: Technology-related announcements and initiatives

<Info>
  Tech Stack data is continuously updated as new information becomes available, ensuring you have the most current view of their technology landscape.

### **Favourites Category**

<Info>
  You can customize which technologies are most important to your sales process by setting up Favourites in Settings â†’ Technologies. This creates a filtered view showing only the technologies most relevant to your solution.
</Info>

The Favourites category allows you to:

- Focus on technologies that directly relate to your value proposition
- Quickly identify accounts using your key integration partners
- Streamline tech stack analysis for faster qualification
- Create consistent technology-focused talking points across your team

## Using Tech Stack Insights

### **Sales Qualification**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Solution Fit">
    - Identify if they use technologies you integrate with
    - Spot gaps where your solution could add value
    - Understand their current tech investment level
    - Assess modernization vs. legacy environment
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Competitive Intelligence">
    - See if they're already using competitor solutions
    - Identify upcoming technology refresh cycles
    - Understand their vendor preferences and relationships
    - Spot opportunities for platform consolidation
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Technical Readiness">
    - Evaluate their technical sophistication
    - Assess implementation complexity requirements
    - Identify potential integration challenges
    - Understand their development and deployment practices
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### **Conversation Starters**

Use tech stack insights to create relevant, credible conversations:

**For Development Teams:**
"I noticed you're using Kubernetes extensively. How are you handling monitoring and observability across your containerized applications?"

**For Data Teams:**
"I see you've invested heavily in Snowflake. How are you managing data quality and governance as you scale your analytics?"

**For Security Teams:**
"Your job postings mention Zero Trust architecture. What's driving that security transformation initiative?"

## Filtering and Search

### **Category Filtering**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="By Technology Type">
    Filter by categories like Cloud, Database, Security, DevOps to focus on relevant technologies for your solution area.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="By Implementation Stage">
    Identify technologies they're actively hiring for vs. maintaining, indicating current vs. future focus areas.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="By Frequency">
    See which technologies appear most often in their job postings, indicating primary vs. secondary platforms.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### **Technology Search**

Quickly find specific technologies:

- Search for exact technology names (e.g., "PostgreSQL", "React")
- Look for technology categories (e.g., "database", "container")
- Find complementary technologies to your solution
- Identify technology stacks that indicate good fit

## Interpreting Tech Stack Data

### **Signal Strength Indicators**

<Warning>
  High mention frequency in job postings typically indicates active use and investment, while single mentions may be aspirational or legacy.
</Warning>

**Strong Signals:**

- Multiple recent job postings requiring specific technology
- Senior-level positions (architects, leads) mentioning technology
- Technology paired with "scaling" or "modernization" keywords
- Multiple related technologies in the same ecosystem

**Weak Signals:**

- Single mention in older job posting
- Technology listed without context or requirements
- Contradictory technologies suggesting experimentation
- Technologies mentioned in junior or intern positions only

### **Technology Maturity Assessment**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Cutting-Edge">
    Latest versions, emerging technologies, innovation-focused hiring
  </Step>
  <Step title="Modern">
    Current industry-standard technologies, regular updates
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stable">
    Established technologies, focus on maintenance and optimization
