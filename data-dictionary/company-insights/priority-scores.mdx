Priority Scores are quantitative measures that indicate how much emphasis a company places on specific business initiatives based on the frequency and prominence of mentions across their strategic communications.

## What Are Priority Scores?

Priority Scores represent the relative importance companies place on key business themes:

- **High Scores (81+)**: Frequently mentioned, prominently featured initiatives
- **Medium Scores (60-80)**: Regularly discussed, moderate emphasis areas
- **Low Scores (0-59)**: Occasionally mentioned, lower priority topics
- **Zero Scores (0)**: Not mentioned or not relevant to the company

<Info>
  Priority Scores are calculated using AI analysis of annual reports, earnings calls, quarterly reports, and strategic communications, measuring both frequency and contextual importance of mentions.

## Why Priority Scores Matter for Sales

### **Quantified Relevance**

Priority Scores help you:

- Objectively measure alignment between your solution and their focus areas
- Prioritize accounts based on strategic fit rather than just company size
- Identify which value propositions will resonate most strongly
- Compare relative importance of different initiatives within the same account

### **Account Prioritization**

Use Priority Scores to:

- Rank prospects by strategic alignment with your solution
- Focus sales efforts on accounts with high-scoring relevant initiatives
- Customize messaging based on their highest-priority areas
- Allocate territory resources to best-fit opportunities

### **Sales Conversations**

- **High Priority (8-10)**: "I noticed digital transformation is a major focus for you..."
- **Medium Priority (5-7)**: "Along with your other initiatives, how important is cost reduction?"
- **Low Priority (1-4)**: Acknowledge but don't lead with these areas
- **Zero Priority (0)**: Avoid focusing on these areas unless they emerge in discovery

### **Competitive Positioning**

- Emphasize areas where you have high scores and competitors likely have lower scores
- De-emphasize areas where you have low scores even if they're high priority for the account
- Create urgency around high-scoring initiatives with time sensitivity
- Build business cases around their highest-priority initiatives

## Best Practices

<Warning>
  Priority Scores reflect public communications, not necessarily internal execution reality. Always validate through discovery conversations.
</Warning>

1. **Lead with High Scores**: Focus messaging on their highest-priority initiatives
2. **Validate Assumptions**: Use scores to guide questions, not make statements
3. **Compare Competitors**: Look at priority scores across peer companies
4. **Track Changes**: Monitor how priority scores evolve over time

## Interpreting Priority Scores

### **Score Ranges**

- **9-10**: Core strategic imperatives, board-level priorities, significant investment
- **7-8**: Important initiatives, regular executive attention, allocated resources
- **5-6**: Standard business priorities, moderate emphasis, ongoing attention
- **3-4**: Emerging or declining priorities, limited mention, minimal focus
- **1-2**: Minimal priority, rare mentions, likely not actively pursued
- **0**: Not mentioned or not applicable to their business model

### **Contextual Factors**

- **Industry Trends**: Some priorities may be industry-standard rather than company-specific
- **Company Size**: Larger companies may show more diverse priority distributions
- **Market Conditions**: Economic factors may influence priority emphasis
- **Leadership Changes**: New executives may shift priority focus areas

## Integration with Sales Process

Priority Scores enhance your sales approach by:

- **Lead Qualification**: Score prospects based on strategic alignment
- **Message Customization**: Tailor outreach to their highest priorities
- **Discovery Focus**: Concentrate questions on high-scoring initiative areas
- **Proposal Structure**: Organize proposals around their priority rankings
- **ROI Calculation**: Weight business case elements by their priority scores
