Priority Scores are quantitative measures that indicate how much emphasis a company places on specific business initiatives based on the frequency and prominence of mentions across their strategic communications.

Priority Scores represent the relative importance companies place on key business themes using a 0-10 scale:

- Annual reports and investor communications
- Earnings calls and executive presentations
- Strategic planning documents and board communications
- Public statements and press releases

<Info>
  Priority Scores are calculated using AI analysis of annual reports, earnings calls, quarterly reports, and strategic communications, measuring both frequency and contextual importance of mentions.
