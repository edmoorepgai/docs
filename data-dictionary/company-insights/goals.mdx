Goals are the specific, measurable business objectives and targets that companies establish to achieve their Strategic Priorities, often including timelines, metrics, and success criteria.

## What Are Goals?

Goals represent the concrete, actionable objectives that companies set to execute their strategic vision:

- Specific revenue, growth, or market share targets
- Operational efficiency and cost reduction objectives
- Customer satisfaction and retention goals
- Technology implementation and transformation milestones

<Info>
  Goals are typically more specific and measurable than Strategic Priorities, often including quantitative targets, timelines, and success metrics extracted from earnings calls, annual reports, and strategic communications.
