Goals are the specific, measurable business objectives and targets that companies establish to achieve their Strategic Priorities, often including timelines, metrics, and success criteria.

Goals represent the concrete, actionable objectives that companies set to execute their strategic vision:

- Annual reports and investor communications
- Earnings calls and executive presentations
- Strategic planning documents and board communications
- Public statements and press releases

<Info>
  Goals are typically more specific and measurable than Strategic Priorities, often including quantitative targets, timelines, and success metrics extracted from earnings calls, annual reports, and strategic communications.
