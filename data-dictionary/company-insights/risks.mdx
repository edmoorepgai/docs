Risks are the potential challenges, threats, and obstacles that companies identify as factors that could negatively impact their business performance, strategic objectives, or operational capabilities.

## What Are Risks?

Risks represent the concerns and challenges that leadership acknowledges could affect their business success:

- Market and competitive pressures
- Operational and technology vulnerabilities
- Financial and regulatory challenges
- Strategic execution obstacles

<Info>
  Risks are extracted from risk management sections in annual reports, earnings call discussions, regulatory filings, and executive commentary about potential business challenges.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### **Value Proposition Development**

- Quantify potential costs of risks to justify investment
- Create business cases around risk avoidance and protection
- Demonstrate how you reduce probability or impact of identified risks

### **Competitive Advantage**

- Position as insurance against business disruption

## Best Practices

<Warning>
  Be careful not to create unnecessary fear or anxiety. Use risk information to demonstrate understanding and position solutions, not to alarm prospects.
</Warning>

1. **Acknowledge Reality**: Show you understand their business challenges
2. **Offer Solutions**: Always follow risk discussions with how you help
3. **Quantify Impact**: Help them understand the cost of inaction
4. **Build Urgency**: Connect risks to timing and competitive pressure

## Integration with Sales Process

Risks enhance your sales approach through:

- **Prospecting**: Create relevant outreach addressing their known concerns
- **Discovery**: Explore impact and likelihood of identified risks
- **Presentation**: Position your solution as protection against key risks
- **Business Case**: Include risk mitigation value in ROI calculations
- **Closing**: Create urgency through potential negative outcomes
