Risks are the potential challenges, threats, and obstacles that companies identify as factors that could negatively impact their business performance, strategic objectives, or operational capabilities.

Risks represent the concerns and challenges that leadership acknowledges could affect their business success:

- Annual reports and investor communications
- Earnings calls and executive presentations
- Strategic planning documents and board communications
- Public statements and press releases

<Info>
  Risks are extracted from risk management sections in annual reports, earnings call discussions, regulatory filings, and executive commentary about potential business challenges.
