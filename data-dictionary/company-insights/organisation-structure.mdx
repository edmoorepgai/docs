Organization Structure provides detailed insights into how companies organize their business units, divisions, and reporting relationships, including key executives and decision-makers within each organizational segment.

## What is Organization Structure?

Organization Structure maps the operational framework of companies, showing:

- Business divisions and their specific focus areas
- Reporting relationships and hierarchical structure
- Key executives and their areas of responsibility
- Division-specific priorities and strategic initiatives

<Info>
  Organization Structure is compiled from annual reports, organizational charts, executive profiles, and corporate communications that detail business unit operations and leadership.
