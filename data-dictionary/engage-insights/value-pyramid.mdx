The Value Pyramid is a structured visual framework that creates a compelling narrative by connecting your target account's strategic priorities and business challenges directly to your solution's capabilities and value proposition.

The Value Pyramid maps account intelligence to your solution foundation:

- Strategic priorities and business objectives
- Goals, challenges, and digital strategies
- Technology stack and organizational context
- Your configured value propositions and capabilities

<Info>
  Value Pyramids are automatically generated based on the account's strategic priorities, initiatives, and challenges, then mapped to your company's value propositions configured in Settings â†’ Engage.
