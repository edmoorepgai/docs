title: "Value Pyramid"
description: "Visual framework connecting customer strategies to your solution capabilities"
---

The Value Pyramid is a structured visual framework that creates a compelling narrative by connecting your target account's strategic priorities and business challenges directly to your solution's capabilities and value proposition.

## What is the Value Pyramid?

The Value Pyramid is a hierarchical visualization that demonstrates solution alignment by mapping:

- Customer strategic priorities and business objectives at the top
- Specific initiatives and programs supporting those strategies in the middle
- Tactical challenges and obstacles preventing success at the base
- Your solution's capabilities as the foundation enabling their success

<Info>
  Value Pyramids are automatically generated based on the account's strategic priorities, initiatives, and challenges, then mapped to your company's value propositions configured in Settings â†’ Engage.

1. Start with strategic objectives they've publicly committed to achieving
2. Acknowledge the specific initiatives they're pursuing to reach those goals
3. Explore the challenges preventing success in those initiatives
4. Position your solution as the foundation that removes those obstacles

**Bottom-Up Approach (Technical Meetings):**
1. Begin by understanding their current challenges and pain points
2. Connect those challenges to broader initiatives they're trying to advance
3. Link initiatives to the strategic objectives they support
4. Show how solving tactical challenges enables strategic success

## Best Practices

<Warning>
  Value Pyramids should tell their story, not yours. Always validate that the strategic priorities and initiatives accurately reflect their current reality before presenting.
</Warning>

1. **Validate Before Presenting**: Confirm strategic priorities and initiatives are current and accurate
2. **Use Their Language**: Adopt their specific terminology and strategic vocabulary
3. **Connect All Levels**: Ensure clear logical connections between each pyramid level
4. **Customize for Audience**: Emphasize levels most relevant to your meeting participants
5. **Update Regularly**: Refresh pyramids as their strategies and initiatives evolve
