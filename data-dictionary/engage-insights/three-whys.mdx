title: "Three Whys"
description: "Create compelling narratives for change that address key buyer questions"
---

The Three Whys framework creates a compelling narrative for change by systematically addressing the fundamental questions every buyer asks: Why should we change from our current approach? Why should we act now rather than later? Why should we choose your solution over alternatives?

## What are the Three Whys?

The Three Whys is a proven sales methodology that structures your business case around three critical buyer concerns:

- **Why Change?** - Articulates the cost and risk of maintaining the status quo
- **Why Now?** - Creates urgency and timing pressure for taking action
- **Why You?** - Differentiates your solution and company from alternatives

<Info>
  Three Whys frameworks are automatically generated based on the account's specific business context, strategic priorities, challenges, and your company's unique value propositions.
