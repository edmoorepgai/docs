## Three Whys in Action

  <ScenarioCard title="Discovery Call">
    ```conversation
    Rep: "What happens if you keep the current system?"

    Prospect: "We'll manage, but it's getting harder."

    Rep: "I understand. [Competitor] said the same thing 
    until they had a $5M outage. The risk grows exponentially 
    as you scale. Worth exploring how to avoid that?"
