    Subject: [Company]'s 2025 operational efficiency target
    
    Hi [Name],
    
    Your CFO mentioned in Q3 earnings that hitting the 20% 
    efficiency target is critical for maintaining margins.
    
    We helped [Competitor] exceed similar targets - they hit 
    24% in 8 months through our approach to [specific area].
    
    Worth a brief call to share what worked?
    ```

    
    ```email Technical
    Subject: Solving the [Technology] scaling challenge
    
    Hi [Name],
    
    Saw your team's posts about hitting scaling limits with 
    [Technology] as you grow past 10M daily transactions.
    
    We solved this exact problem for [Similar Company] without 
    requiring a full re-architecture. They now handle 50M daily.
    
    Interested in how they did it?
