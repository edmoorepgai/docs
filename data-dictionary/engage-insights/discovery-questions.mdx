## Real Discovery Examples

<ExampleConversation>
  <Turn speaker="Rep">
    "I noticed you're hiring 50 data engineers this year. That's impressive
    growth. What's driving that expansion?"
  </Turn>

  <Turn speaker="Prospect">
    "We're trying to handle 10x more data but our current infrastructure
    can't scale."
  </Turn>

  <Turn speaker="Rep">
    "10x is significant. What happens if the infrastructure can't keep up
    with the hiring?"
  </Turn>

  <Turn speaker="Prospect">
    "Honestly? We'd have expensive engineers sitting idle, and our product
    roadmap would slip."
