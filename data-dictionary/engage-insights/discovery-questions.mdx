## Best Practices for Using Discovery Questions

1. **Prioritize by Relevance**: Choose questions most aligned with their highest-priority initiatives
2. **Match Meeting Context**: Select questions appropriate for the audience and meeting purpose
3. **Build Conversation Flow**: Order questions to create natural progression and deepening understanding
4. **Leave Room for Follow-up**: Use generated questions as starting points for deeper exploration
