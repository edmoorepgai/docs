Content templates transform your saved frameworks into personalized, account-specific messaging. Understanding how to effectively use templates ensures consistent, high-quality communication across all your accounts.

Templates can be used in two primary locations, each serving different purposes in your sales workflow.

## Account-Level Content Generation

**When to Use**: Creating content for general account outreach, proposals, or account-wide messaging

**Step-by-Step Process:**

2. Click into the account to access the account intelligence page
3. Select the **Content** tab from the account navigation
4. Click **Draft Content** to open the template selector
5. Choose your desired template from the available options
6. Content generates automatically using all available account intelligence
7. Review the generated content for accuracy and relevance

**Enhanced Personalization:**

- Tailors value propositions to their decision-making authority
- Incorporates any available background information about the individual

## Customizing Context Data

Every time you generate content, you can override the template's default context data to focus on specific aspects of the account intelligence.

**How to Modify Context Data:**

1. After selecting a template but before generating content
2. Click the **Context Data** button in the generation interface
3. Review the currently selected data sources
4. **Add** additional context sources relevant to your specific use case
5. **Remove** context sources that aren't relevant for this particular content
6. Click **Generate** with your customized context selection

## Content Quality and Optimization

**Reviewing Generated Content:**
Before using any generated content, review for:

- **Accuracy**: Verify all company information and context is correct
- **Relevance**: Ensure the content addresses the recipient's likely priorities
- **Tone**: Confirm the messaging matches your intended communication style
- **Completeness**: Check that all key points and calls-to-action are included
- **Personalization**: Validate that account-specific details are meaningful and accurate

**Making Improvements:**

- **Edit directly**: Modify generated content to better match your style or add specific details
- **Regenerate with changes**: Adjust context data and generate new version if significant changes are needed
- **Save variations**: Keep multiple versions for A/B testing different approaches
- **Template feedback**: Note what works well to improve future template instructions

## Advanced Usage Strategies

**Template Sequencing:**
Create content series using multiple related templates:

1. **Initial Outreach**: Introduction and value proposition
2. **Follow-up**: Reference previous communication and add new insights
3. **Deep Dive**: Technical or detailed business case content
4. **Executive Summary**: C-level focused outcomes and next steps

**Team Collaboration:**

- **Share successful content**: Save high-performing generated content for team reference
- **Template feedback**: Provide input on template quality to improve shared resources
- **Content libraries**: Build account-specific content libraries using templates
- **Best practices sharing**: Document which templates work best for different scenarios

**Performance Tracking:**

- Monitor response rates by template and account type
- Track which context combinations generate the most engaging content
- Measure time saved compared to creating content from scratch
- Identify templates that need updates or improvements

<Tip>
  Generated content is a starting point, not a final product. Always review and customize based on your specific relationship with the account and any recent interactions or developments.
