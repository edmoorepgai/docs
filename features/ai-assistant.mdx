        What's the best way to position our solution for Acme's cloud migration?
      </ChatMessage>

      <ChatMessage role="assistant">
        Based on Acme's Q3 announcement, they're prioritizing cost optimization during their AWS migration. Their CFO mentioned a 20% reduction target.

        Position around:

        1. Cost visibility during migration
        2. Automated optimization post-migration
        3. Similar customer saved 24% in 6 months

        Lead with ROI, not features.

        I have a meeting with the CTO of DataCorp tomorrow. What should I focus on?
      </ChatBubble>

      <ChatBubble role="assistant">
        Based on DataCorp's recent activities:

        **Key Focus Areas:**

        1. Their "Project Lightning" - modernizing data infrastructure by Q2
        2. CTO's LinkedIn posts show frustration with current query speeds
        3. They're hiring 20 data engineers - scaling challenges

        **Discovery Questions:**

        * "How is Project Lightning progressing against the Q2 deadline?"
        * "What's the impact of slow queries on your data scientists?"
        * "How are you planning to onboard 20 new engineers?"

        **Value Prop:** Lead with performance (100x faster queries) and developer experience.

        They mentioned they're also evaluating CompetitorX. How do I position against them?
      </ChatBubble>

      <ChatBubble role="assistant">
        CompetitorX is strong on price but here's your differentiation:

        **Technical Advantages:**

        * 10x faster performance on complex queries (verified by Gartner)
        * No data movement required (they require ETL)
        * Real-time vs. their 15-minute lag

        **Business Advantages:**

        * 60% less admin overhead (important given their hiring challenges)
        * DataCorp's peer TechGiant switched from CompetitorX to us
        * Our SOC2 Type II covers their compliance needs

        **Trap Question:** "How important is real-time data for Project Lightning?"
