  **You:** What's the best way to position our solution for Acme's cloud migration?

  <Accordion title="Pre-Meeting Intelligence" icon="calendar">
    **You:** I have a meeting with the CTO of DataCorp tomorrow. What should I focus on?

    **AI Assistant:** Based on DataCorp's recent activities:

    **Key Focus Areas:**

    1. Their "Project Lightning" - modernizing data infrastructure by Q2
    2. CTO's LinkedIn posts show frustration with current query speeds
    3. They're hiring 20 data engineers - scaling challenges

    **Discovery Questions:**

    - "How is Project Lightning progressing against the Q2 deadline?"
    - "What's the impact of slow queries on your data scientists?"
    - "How are you planning to onboard 20 new engineers?"

    **Value Prop:** Lead with performance (100x faster queries) and developer experience.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Competitive Intelligence" icon="shield">
    **You:** They mentioned they're also evaluating CompetitorX. How do I position against them?

    **AI Assistant:** CompetitorX is strong on price but here's your differentiation:

    **Technical Advantages:**

    - 10x faster performance on complex queries (verified by Gartner)
    - No data movement required (they require ETL)
    - Real-time vs. their 15-minute lag

    **Business Advantages:**

    - 60% less admin overhead (important given their hiring challenges)
    - DataCorp's peer TechGiant switched from CompetitorX to us
    - Our SOC2 Type II covers their compliance needs

    **Trap Question:** "How important is real-time data for Project Lightning?"
