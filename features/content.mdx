    ```text
    Subject: Quick question about Acme's 20% efficiency target
    
    Hi Sarah,
    
    I noticed in Acme's Q3 earnings call that you're targeting 
    20% operational efficiency gains by year-end to offset the 
    margin pressure from rising labor costs.
    
    We recently helped GlobalManufacturing achieve 24% efficiency 
    improvement in 7 months through intelligent automation - 
    exceeding their 18% target.
    
    The key was focusing on their highest-volume processes first, 
    which I believe could work well for Acme's distribution centers.
    
    Worth a brief call to discuss their approach?
    
    Best regards,
    [Name]

    Subject: Solving the real-time data challenge at scale
    
    Hi Marcus,
    
    Your team's recent blog post about handling 10M events/second 
    was impressive. The custom Kafka optimization was clever.
    
    But I imagine maintaining that custom solution while scaling 
    to your 2025 target of 50M events/second is keeping you up 
    at night?
    
    We helped TechGiant solve this exact challenge - they now 
    handle 100M events/second with 3 engineers instead of 15.
    
    Interested in their architecture? Happy to share the 
    technical deep-dive.
