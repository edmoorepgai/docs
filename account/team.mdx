## Team Structure

Create teams that reflect your sales organization:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create team">
    Define a clear team name (e.g., "North America Sales", "Enterprise AEs")
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign manager">
    Designate a team manager for analytics visibility
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add members">
    Select users to include in the team
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save configuration">

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<Warning>
Limit Super Admin access to 1-2 essential personnel. Most users should have Common User roles.
</Warning>

**Role Guidelines:**
- **Super Admin**: Sales ops leaders, system administrators (1-2 people)
- **Admin**: Team managers, sales enablement staff
- **Common User**: Sales reps, AEs, SDRs, end users

**Team Structure:**
- Mirror your actual sales organization
- Keep teams simple and meaningful for analytics
- Update teams as your organization evolves
