Team settings allow you to manage user access, assign roles, and create team structures within PG:AI. Control who has access to your workspace, organize users into logical teams, and ensure proper permissions are in place for effective collaboration.

## Team Management Overview

Team settings provide two main areas of control:

- **User Management**: Add, remove, and manage individual user accounts and permissions
- **Team Structure**: Create teams with designated managers and members for better organization

<Info>
  Proper team configuration enables better analytics, clearer accountability, and more effective collaboration across your sales organization.

## Best Practices

### **User Role Assignment**

<Warning>
  Limit Super Admin access to essential personnel only. Most users should be assigned Common User roles with Admin roles reserved for team leaders and operations staff.
</Warning>

**Role Assignment Guidelines:**

- **Super Admin**: 1-2 per organization (sales ops leaders, system administrators)
- **Admin**: Team managers, sales enablement, operations staff
- **Common User**: Sales reps, AEs, SDRs, and other end users

### **Team Structure Strategy**

Consider these factors when creating teams:

1. **Mirror Sales Organization**: Align PG:AI teams with your actual sales structure
2. **Enable Proper Analytics**: Teams should be meaningful for performance analysis
3. **Maintain Simplicity**: Avoid over-complicating with too many small teams
4. **Update Regularly**: Adjust teams as your organization evolves

## Team Analytics Benefits

Well-configured teams enable:

- **Performance Comparison**: Compare activity levels across different teams
- **Adoption Tracking**: Identify which teams are embracing PG:AI most effectively
- **Manager Visibility**: Give team leaders insight into their team's platform usage
- **Targeted Training**: Identify teams that need additional enablement
