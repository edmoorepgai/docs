Usage and Analytics shows how your team uses PG:AI, which accounts get the most attention, and overall platform adoption metrics. Track engagement patterns and measure the value PG:AI delivers to your sales process.

## Account Analytics

Track engagement metrics for all accounts your teams have added:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Engagement Metrics" icon="chart-line">
    Total events, page views, active days, and unique user views per account
  </Card>
  <Card title="Account Details" icon="building">
    Company info, who added the account, and when it was last accessed
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Key Metrics:**

- **Total Events** - All interactions with an account (views, exports, AI usage)
- **Unique Users** - Number of team members who accessed the account
- **Active Days** - Days with at least one team member engagement
- **Days Since Last Activity** - Helps identify stale accounts needing attention

## User Analytics

Monitor individual and team platform usage:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Overview">
    - Credit usage (bought vs. used)
    - Monthly trends for companies added
    - Custom insights and content created
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="User Details">
    - Login count and days active
    - Companies added per user
    - AI feature usage
    - Content exports performed
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Activity Tracker">
    - Detailed audit log of all platform actions
    - Filter by date range
    - Track specific user behaviors
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Using Analytics

**Account Attribution:**

- Identify high-collaboration accounts
- Find neglected accounts needing attention
- Correlate engagement with pipeline success

**User Adoption:**

- Find power users to champion best practices
- Identify users needing additional training
- Track which features deliver value

<Warning>
  Login counts may be lower than days active because users accessing PG:AI via shared email links don't count as "logins."
</Warning>
