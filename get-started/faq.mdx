## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is PG:AI and what problem does it solve?">
    PG:AI is an AI Knowledge platform for B2B sales people that helps teams research target accounts, prepare for meetings, and create personalized outreach content. It solves the problem of time-consuming manual research by automatically generating comprehensive account intelligence and mapping it to your company's value proposition. Instead of spending hours on pre-meeting research, sales professionals can get strategic insights in minutes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How is PG:AI different from other sales intelligence tools?">
    PG:AI goes beyond basic contact and firmographic data. Unlike traditional tools that focus on data aggregation, PG:AI analyzes strategic priorities, digital initiatives, and business goals to help you understand what matters most to your prospects. It then maps these insights to your value proposition, creating contextual messaging and meeting preparation materials.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What are the main components of the PG:AI platform?">
    PG:AI has several core components:

    - **Overview section**: Provides strategic priorities, goals, digital initiatives, and org structure information about target accounts
    - **Custom Insights**: Pre-populated answers to key questions about the account
    - **Engage section**: Maps your value proposition to the account's priorities and challenges
    - **Personas**: Identifies key stakeholders and builds persona-specific messaging
    - **Content generation**: Creates emails, call scripts, and meeting preparation notes
    - **AI Assistant**: Allows you to ask specific questions about accounts
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What industries or company types is PG:AI designed for?">
    PG:AI is industry-agnostic and works for companies of all types, though it delivers the most value for complex B2B selling environments. It's particularly useful for technology sales, financial services, logistics, insurance, enterprise software, and other solutions where understanding a prospect's strategic priorities is crucial. While it works best when used for public companies (due to more available information), it can also be effective for larger private companies.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can PG:AI help with account prioritization?">
    Yes, PG:AI can analyze your entire target account list to identify which accounts have strategic priorities that best align with your solution. This helps sales teams focus on accounts with the highest likelihood of conversion rather than just working through alphabetical or revenue-based lists.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can PG:AI be used for existing customers, not just prospects?">
    Absolutely. Many companies use PG:AI to prepare for quarterly business reviews, identify expansion opportunities, and stay informed about their customers' evolving priorities. It's particularly useful for account managers and customer success teams who need to stay on top of customer initiatives.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can PG:AI help with competitive positioning?">
    Yes, by understanding a prospect's strategic priorities, you can position your solution against competitors in the context of what matters most to the prospect. Some companies also use PG:AI to research accounts that use competitive solutions to identify potential displacement opportunities.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does PG:AI work for international accounts?">
    Yes, PG:AI works with companies worldwide and supports multiple languages. For non-English companies, it will analyze content in both English and the local language to ensure comprehensive coverage. The output can also be generated in multiple languages to support global sales teams.

    Yes, PG:AI analyzes job postings to identify technologies mentioned in job requirements. This gives you insights into a company's tech stack.

## Pricing and Licensing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does PG:AI's pricing model work?">
    PG:AI uses an account-based pricing model. You pay for the number of accounts you want to research, not the number of users. This means everyone on your team can access all accounts without additional per-user fees. The standard price is \$25 per account per year, with volume discounts available for larger account packages.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is a 'credit' in PG:AI?">
    A credit represents one account. When you add a company to PG:AI, you use one credit, which gives you access to all information about that company for 12 months, including all updates and new insights. Credits cannot be reused - if you remove an account, you cannot apply that credit to a new account.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do you offer a trial of PG:AI?">
    Yes, PG:AI offers evaluation accounts with a limited number of credits so you can test the platform with your own target accounts. During the evaluation period, you'll have access to all features and can fully explore how PG:AI fits into your sales process. Many customers start with 10-20 accounts to test effectiveness before expanding.
