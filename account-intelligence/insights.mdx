The Custom Insights tab provides specialized analysis focused on specific topics, initiatives, or use cases that matter to your business. Unlike general company intelligence, these insights dive deep into areas directly relevant to your solution.

<Info>
  Custom Insights are configured by your admin in Settings â†’ Custom Insights. Each insight type is tailored to your company's specific value propositions and sales needs.
