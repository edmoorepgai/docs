# Custom Insights

Custom Insights provide targeted intelligence about your accounts related to specific topics, initiatives, or use cases that matter to your business. These AI-powered insights go beyond general company information to focus on exactly what you need to know.

<Info>
Custom Insights are configured by your admin in Settings â†’ Custom Insights. Each insight type is tailored to your company's specific value propositions and sales needs.

## Maximizing Insight Value

### **Best Practices**

<Warning>
Not every account will have detailed information for every insight type. Focus on insights with strong signals rather than forcing connections.
</Warning>

1. **Prioritize High-Confidence Insights**: Start conversations with well-documented initiatives
2. **Combine Multiple Insights**: Look for patterns across different insight types
3. **Verify with Discovery**: Use insights as starting points, not absolute truth
4. **Track What Works**: Note which insights lead to productive conversations
5. **Request New Types**: Ask your admin to add insight types for emerging needs

### **Insight Interpretation**

- **Direct Mentions**: Strongest signal - explicitly stated initiatives
- **Related Investments**: Good signal - hiring or spending in area
- **Industry Trends**: Moderate signal - following sector patterns
- **Absence of Data**: May indicate opportunity or lack of priority

## Requesting New Insight Types

2. **Define Success**: How would you use this insight?
3. **Provide Examples**: What signals indicate this topic?
4. **Submit Request**: Contact your admin or PG:AI support

<Note>
The most effective Custom Insights are specific enough to be actionable but broad enough to apply across multiple accounts.
