## Quick Context

**Priority Scores Explained**
Our analysis of how much they actually talk about different topics. A score of 100+ means they won't shut up about it in investor calls. Under 50? They mention it once and move on.

**The Money Story**
For public companies, you get the full financial picture: income statements, balance sheets, stock performance, and quarterly trends. Private companies show what we can piece together from available sources.

**Real Intelligence, Real Sources**
These aren't marketing fluff - they're initiatives getting real budget and executive attention, pulled from earnings calls, annual reports, and strategic communications.
