## Three Whys Framework

The Three Whys create a compelling narrative for change that addresses the key questions every buyer asks.

### **Why Change?**

Articulates the cost of status quo:
- Current pain points and inefficiencies
- Competitive disadvantages
- Missed opportunities
- Rising costs or risks
- Customer satisfaction issues

**Example Output:**
"Your current fragmented data architecture is limiting your ability to deliver real-time customer insights, resulting in missed revenue opportunities and declining customer satisfaction scores."

### **Why Now?**

Creates urgency for action:
- Market pressures or opportunities
- Regulatory deadlines
- Competitive moves
- Technology end-of-life
- Strategic initiative timelines

**Example Output:**
"With your digital transformation initiative targeting 40% of revenue from digital channels by 2025, delaying modern data infrastructure puts this critical goal at risk."

### **Why You?**

Differentiates your solution:
- Unique capabilities for their needs
- Proven success in their industry
- Specific alignment with their environment
- Risk mitigation approach
- Partnership value beyond technology

**Example Output:**
"Unlike traditional providers, our platform is built specifically for enterprises undergoing digital transformation, with proven success helping 3 of your top 5 competitors achieve similar goals."

### **Using Discovery Questions**

Best practices for deployment:
1. **Don't Use All Questions**: Select 5-7 most relevant for your meeting
2. **Customize Language**: Adapt to their terminology and context
3. **Listen for Depth**: Use follow-up questions to go deeper
4. **Document Answers**: Capture responses for proposal development
5. **Share with Team**: Ensure consistent discovery across opportunities

## Facts & Figures

Relevant data points that support your value proposition and create credibility.

### **Types of Facts Provided**

- **Investment Levels**: "Investing $50M in digital transformation"
- **Timeline Data**: "Targeting cloud migration completion by Q4 2025"
- **Performance Metrics**: "Currently achieving 72% customer satisfaction"
- **Scale Indicators**: "Processing 1M transactions daily"
- **Growth Targets**: "Aiming for 25% revenue growth"
- **Efficiency Goals**: "Seeking 30% cost reduction"

### **Using Facts Effectively**

<Warning>
Always verify facts during discovery. Use PG:AI data as conversation starters, not absolute truth.
</Warning>

**In Conversations:**
"I noticed you mentioned investing $50M in digital transformation. How is that budget being allocated across initiatives?"

**In Proposals:**
"Based on your goal of 30% cost reduction, our solution typically delivers 25-35% operational savings..."

**In Business Cases:**
"With 1M daily transactions, even 1% improvement in processing efficiency represents significant value..."
