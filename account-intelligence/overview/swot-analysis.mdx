## Best Practices

<Warning>
  Never directly tell a prospect about their weaknesses. Instead, ask discovery questions that help them articulate these challenges themselves.
</Warning>

1. **Be Diplomatic**: Frame weaknesses as "areas for improvement" or "opportunities"
2. **Use Their Words**: Reference weaknesses using their own terminology from reports
3. **Focus on External**: Opportunities and threats are safer conversation starters
4. **Provide Hope**: Always pair problems with potential solutions
5. **Stay Current**: SWOT elements can change quickly - verify before using
6. **Think Holistically**: Consider how SWOT elements interact and compound
