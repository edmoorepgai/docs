The Contacts feature helps you identify, understand, and engage with key stakeholders at your target accounts by combining role identification with persona-based intelligence.

<Note>
  Contact personas must be configured in Settings â†’ Personas before using this feature. This ensures consistent targeting across your organization.
</Note>

## How Contact Discovery Works

PG:AI identifies contacts by:

1. **Analyzing public professional data** from web sources
2. **Matching job titles** to your defined personas
3. **Extracting career history** and experience indicators
4. **Generating relevant insights** for each contact type
5. **Creating persona-specific content** for engagement

## Understanding Personas

### **What Are Personas?**

Personas are role-based categories that group similar stakeholders:

- **Economic Buyers**: CFO, VP Finance, Budget holders
- **Technical Buyers**: CTO, IT Directors, Architects
- **Champions**: Innovation leads, transformation managers
- **Influencers**: Department heads, senior managers
- **End Users**: Practitioners, analysts, operators

<Tip>
  Work with your sales enablement team to define personas that match your typical buying committee structure.
</Tip>

### **Persona Configuration**

Each persona should include:

- **Title Keywords**: Terms that identify this persona (e.g., "Chief Financial", "VP Finance", "Treasurer")
