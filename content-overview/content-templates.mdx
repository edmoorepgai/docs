Content Templates are AI-powered instructions that generate personalized content for your target accounts. Each template combines your messaging requirements with account-specific intelligence to create relevant, customized communication.

<Info>
Content Templates use account intelligence, contact insights, and your business context to generate personalized messaging. Well-crafted templates produce content that feels researched and relevant rather than generic or templated.
</Info>

## How Templates Work

Templates combine multiple inputs to generate personalized content:
- **Instructions** - Your prompt that defines what content to create and how
- **Content Settings** - Format, length, and language specifications  
- **Context Data** - Account intelligence that personalizes the content
- **Datasets** - Your business information and sales collateral
- **Contact Information** - Individual insights when generating person-specific content

## Writing Effective Template Instructions

### **Instruction Structure**
Your template instructions should include:

**Context Setting:**
```
You are writing [content type] from a salesperson at [Your Company] 
to a [recipient role] at [Company Name] with the goal of [objective].
```

**Content Requirements:**
```
The [email/document] should:
- [Specific requirement 1]
- [Specific requirement 2] 
- [Specific requirement 3]
```

**Format Specifications:**
```
Follow this structure:
- [Opening approach]
- [Body content guidelines]
- [Closing/call to action]
```

### **Effective Instruction Examples**

**Personalized Outreach Email:**
```
You are writing an email from a salesperson at [Company] to a [Role] at [Company Name] 
with the goal of booking a meeting to explore how [Solution] can help the company.

The email should:
- Reference a specific strategic initiative or challenge from their context data
- Include relevant proof point or case study
- Present a clear, low-friction meeting request
- Maintain professional but conversational tone

Follow this format:
- Great to see [specific company insight]
- [Relevant business challenge/opportunity] 
- [Your solution's value proposition with proof]
- [Clear call to action]
```

**Executive Summary:**
```
Create an executive summary for [Company Name] analyzing their strategic position 
and challenges that [Your Solution] addresses.

Include:
- 3-5 key strategic priorities from context data
- Relevant market trends affecting their industry
- Specific challenges your solution addresses
- 2-3 comparable companies who've achieved success

Structure as:
- Executive overview (2-3 sentences)
- Strategic priorities and challenges
- Solution alignment and value proposition  
- Next steps recommendation
```

**Technical Brief:**
```
Write a technical brief for [Role] at [Company Name] explaining how [Solution] 
integrates with their current technology stack.

Focus on:
- Technical requirements mentioned in context data
- Integration capabilities relevant to their industry
- Security and compliance considerations
- Implementation timeline and support

Format:
- Technical overview
- Integration approach  
- Security and compliance
- Implementation roadmap
```

<Warning>
Avoid overly generic instructions like "write a good email" or "tell them about our product." Specific, detailed instructions produce higher-quality, more personalized content.
</Warning>

## Template Performance Optimization

### **Content Quality Indicators**

5. **Test again** and repeat until satisfied with quality

## Integration with Content Groups

Individual templates work best when organized into [Content Groups](/content-groups) that address comprehensive use cases. A single template might be used across multiple groups, allowing you to reuse well-performing templates in different contexts while maintaining focused group purposes.

Templates can also be included in [Workflows](/workflows) for automated content generation during account onboarding, ensuring consistent messaging and research across all new accounts.
