title: "Content Groups"
description: "Organize content templates into collections for streamlined personalized content generation"
---

Content Groups let you bundle multiple content templates together so they can be applied to accounts as a unified collection. This streamlines content generation by creating relevant messaging for different stakeholders and use cases in one action.

<Info>
Content Groups determine which personalized content gets generated when applied to an account. Well-organized groups ensure you create comprehensive messaging that covers all key stakeholders and use cases for each target account.
</Info>

## How It Works

Content Groups consist of multiple content templates that work together:
- **Template Collections** - Multiple templates bundled for comprehensive account coverage
- **Unified Generation** - All templates in a group generate content simultaneously  
- **Role-Based Organization** - Group templates by stakeholder type, use case, or sales motion
- **Workflow Integration** - Groups can be included in automated account onboarding workflows

## Effective Group Organization

### **By Stakeholder Type**
- **Executive Group** - CEO email, board summary, strategic overview
- **Technical Group** - Architecture brief, technical comparison, integration guide  
- **Procurement Group** - ROI analysis, vendor comparison, compliance summary

### **By Sales Motion**
- **New Logo Group** - Discovery email, company research, competitive positioning
- **Expansion Group** - Usage analysis, additional use cases, success metrics

## Integration with Workflows

Content Groups integrate with [Workflows](/workflows) to automate content generation during account onboarding. When you add a new company, selected Content Groups automatically generate their full template collection, ensuring consistent account preparation across your team.

Groups can also be applied manually to existing accounts when you need comprehensive content for specific sales activities or stakeholder meetings.
